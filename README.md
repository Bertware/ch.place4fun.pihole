# PiHole Control

This application offers the possibility to control the defined PiHole instances via Homey and to send various functions via the PiHole API.

> Important: This application uses the PiHole API. If the developers decide to change parts or the entire API, the application may no longer work.

Many thanks to [Ronny Winkler](https://rwdevelopment.de/) for his support.
